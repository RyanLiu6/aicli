# Create Pull Request

## Workflow

1. Verify you're NOT on main/master
2. Run `git status` and `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to review changes
3. **Ask user for confirmation** before pushing
4. Push to origin with `-u` flag if needed
5. Create PR with `gh pr create`
6. Return the PR URL

## PR Title Format

- If user provides a Linear ticket (e.g., `[DP-1234]`), use: `[DP-1234] - Brief title`
- Otherwise, just use: `Brief title`

## PR Description Format

Use the template at `templates/pr-description.md`:

```markdown
### Why are you making these changes?

<!-- Explain the context, problem, and solution -->

### How has this been tested?

<!-- Describe testing approach -->
```

## Notes

- If PR already exists, use `gh pr view --web`
- Always check with user before pushing (per git workflow rules)
