# Create Pull Request

## Workflow

1. Verify you're NOT on main/master
2. Run `git status` and `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to review changes
3. **Ask user for confirmation** before pushing
4. Push to origin with `-u` flag if needed
5. Create PR with `gh pr create`
6. Return the PR URL

## PR Format

```markdown
## Summary
- First change (verb: Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Second change
- Third change

## Test plan
[Optional: only if needed]
```

Keep bullets to one line each. No fluff like "This PR implements..."

## Notes

- If PR already exists, use `gh pr view --web`
- Always check with user before pushing (per git workflow rules)
