# Make Commits

Analyze the working tree and create logical commits from staged/unstaged changes.

## Guidelines

- **Logical Grouping**: Split unrelated changes, but prefer fewer commits over excessive granularity
- **Tests with Changes**: Commit tests alongside their implementation
- **No Rewrites**: NEVER modify existing code during this process - only organize what's there
- **Clear Messages**: Follow repo's existing commit style (check `git log`)

## Process

1. Run `git status`, `git diff`, `git diff --staged` to see all changes
2. Verify you're NOT on main/master (ask user for branch name if needed)
3. Run lints/type-checks - stop if they fail
4. Identify logical groups (watch for debug code - ask before removing)
5. Create TodoWrite checklist with one item per planned commit
6. For each commit: stage files, commit with descriptive message, mark todo complete

## Done

When `git status` shows a clean working tree.

## Notes

- Don't push - use `/create-pr` or `/update-pr` for that
- When uncertain about grouping, ask the user
- Never use `git commit --amend`
