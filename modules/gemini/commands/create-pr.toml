# Create Pull Request

Create a pull request with a concise, well-formatted description.

## Workflow

1. **Verify branch**: Ensure you're NOT on main/master branch
2. **Review changes**: Check git status and recent commits
3. **Check with user**: Confirm before pushing (per user's git workflow rules)
4. **Push to origin**: Push to `origin` from the current branch (if needed)
5. **Create PR**: Use `gh pr create` with concise description
6. **Format description**: Small bullet points, derived from conversation and commits

## PR Description Format

Keep it **very concise**. Use this structure:

```
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points of what changed>

## Test plan
[Optional: Only if testing steps are needed]
```

### Good examples

```
## Summary
- Fix deduplication in welcome message
- Add sorting to package list
- Improve logging on package updates
```

```
## Summary
- Add cache timestamp on initial install
- Prevent stale cache issues
```

### Bad examples (too verbose)

```
## Summary
- This PR implements a comprehensive solution to fix the deduplication
  logic in the welcome message handler by refactoring the underlying
  data structure and adding a new sorting algorithm...
```

## Instructions

1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - If on main/master, stop and ask user to create a feature branch

2. Review changes:
   - Run `git status` to see what's committed
   - Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline` (or `master..HEAD`) to see commits
   - Review recent conversation for context

3. Check remote status:
   - Run `git status` to see if branch is already tracking remote
   - If already pushed and up-to-date, skip push step

4. **ASK USER**: "Ready to push and create PR? Here's what will be pushed: [list commits]"
   - Wait for user confirmation
   - This respects the user's git workflow rules

5. Push changes (if user confirmed and needed):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <current-branch>
   ```

6. Create PR with concise description:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "Brief title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   - First change
   - Second change
   - Third change
   EOF
   )"
   ```

7. Return the PR URL to the user

## Key principles

- **Be concise**: Each bullet should be one line
- **Focus on what**: Describe the change, not implementation details
- **Derive from context**: Use commit messages and conversation
- **No fluff**: Avoid phrases like "This PR implements" or "In this change"
- **Action-oriented**: Start bullets with verbs (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)

## Notes

- If `gh pr create` fails because PR already exists, use `gh pr view --web` to open it
- Always respect user's git workflow rules (check before push, use feature branches)
- If branch is already pushed and up-to-date, can skip directly to PR creation
